AWS QuickSight ML Dashboards: Forecasting &amp; Anomaly Detection


Overview

This project showcases my work with AWS QuickSight, where I built a dynamic dashboard integrating ML-powered sales forecasting and anomaly detection. The goal of the project was to demonstrate QuickSight’s capabilities in advanced analytics, particularly its seamless scalability, built-in machine learning, and cost-effective nature.

Features

Sales Forecasting: Utilized QuickSight’s built-in ML capabilities to predict sales trends over time.

Anomaly Detection: Implemented automatic anomaly detection to identify unexpected variations in sales data.

Interactive Dashboards: Created user-friendly dashboards to visualize key insights for decision-making.


Tools and Technologies

AWS QuickSight: For building and visualizing dashboards, incorporating ML models directly.

Data Preparation Tools: Python and Excel were used for initial data cleaning and transformation.

Cloud Integration: QuickSight was integrated with AWS S3 for data storage and retrieval.


Why AWS QuickSight?

Scalability: Seamless integration with AWS services, making it ideal for large datasets.

Built-in ML Analytics: Enabled me to perform advanced forecasting and anomaly detection without external models.

Cost-Effectiveness: Pay-per-session pricing ensures flexibility and affordability.


Comparison with Tableau and Power BI

Having prior experience with Tableau and Power BI, I observed:

Tableau: Excellent for deep visual customizations but lacks native ML integrations.

Power BI: Great for Microsoft ecosystem users but requires external ML models for forecasting.

QuickSight: A perfect blend of scalability, built-in ML features, and ease of use for cloud-native analytics.
